# This is a journal for comp sci - March 12th


- what did we do?
  We talked about how dice system's going to work.
  We also added some new functions on algorithm which we made last class.

- What did I learn?
  How to define the variable outside â†’ then call them by "global x"
  color code ex:(255, 0, 0)
  3ways to express the equation(These equations have same solution indeed)
   - One =  One + 1
   - One += 1
   - One ++
  How to make a bar graph
